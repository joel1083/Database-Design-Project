# Database-Design-Project

## In this project, I was assigned to develop Queries using the “MakeViewer”, “MakeMovie”, and “MakeRating” scripts as shown in the dataset folder, and successfully execute the following commands.



1) Get the reviewers’ IDs that have invalid zipcodes. An invalid zipcode is shorter than 5 characters.

2) Get the movie title for all movies that are both musicals and animations. Rename the output attribute to be “Singing Cartoons.”

3) Get the reviewer ID for female students or students older than 30.

4) How many reviewers have occupations in the arts? List those with an occupation of entertainment, artist, or writer. List them in descending alphabetical order. Give the count column the title "Jobs in the Arts."

5) List all movies released in the 1990’s, sorted by alphabetical order

6) List all “easy” reviewers and their average rating scores – easy reviewers are reviewers whose average rating score is equal to 4.

7) List the youngest age, oldest age, and average age of reviewers for each profession that have given the highest rating to a comedy film. Use a left join.  Add appropriate column titles. Sort the occupations in ascending alphabetical order.

8) List the number of reviewers for each profession, not including librarians or lawyers. Sort the list in descending numerical order by the count column. Give the count column the title "Occupation Count"

9) By Gender, list the average student reviewers’ age, Average Rating, and The number of ratings given to movies made in 1996.  Use the column titles "Average Age", "Average Rating" and "Number of Ratings" for movies made in 1996. HINT: Use multiple left joins.

10) [A] List all occupations in which the male reviewers have an average age above 40.00. Show the results for average age as a decimal number. [B] Submit a second query using only integer values. Do you notice a difference?
